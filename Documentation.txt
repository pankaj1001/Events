1- Installing NodeJS on Machine

    Install latest version of NodeJS from NodeJS.org, it will install nodejs and npm 

2 - Database of the application is hosted on Mongodb ATLAS cloud, you don't need to dp anything for the database.

3 - Running the project

    - Project has been created in ExpressJS using express generator.
    - Front - End is not developed. Use of PostMan required.
    
    - Go to project folder and open Command Prompt(Terminal) as Administrator.
    - Type ' npm install '(without quotes) in Command Prompt(Terminal).
    - Type ' npm start ' to start the server and check various APIs with PostMan.




// Various APIs of the Application.

1- 'localhost:3000/' index route.
2- 'localhost:3000/signup' for registering on the application. (use any valid email and password, valid email validation is present).
3- 'localhost:3000/login' for loging in to the application. (for login you can use ( user-> pankaj.singh1998@gmail.com, pass-> pankaj1234).
4- use token generated after login to bypass authorization of application. (i assume you know how to pass Authporization header from PostMan).
5- play with other APIs.
    localhost:3000/:userId (POST)
    localhost:3000/:userId (GET)
    localhost:3000/:userId/:eventId (GET, PATCH, DELETE).
